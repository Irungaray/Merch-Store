# Merch Store PWA

### Documentation in progress!

**Meanwhile you can try the page yourself at:**

https://merchstore-85845.web.app/

**Or take a look at the Strapi API at:**

https://github.com/Irungaray/Merch-Store-API

The API was deployed to Google Cloud Services and the Client to Firebase via GitHub Actions/Continous Deploys, so maybe you will have some troubles trying to run it locally because it uses GitHub's Secrets.

But, you can try te live version in the link above!

Try it on whatever browser you use, even on phone! It has responsive mobile-first design.

Let me know if you find any bug!

### **Hope you enjoy!**
